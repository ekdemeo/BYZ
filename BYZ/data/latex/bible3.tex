\begin{document}
\bchapter In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
    \bverse And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
    \bverse And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
    \bverse And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

\bchapter Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
   \bverse And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
